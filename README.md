### The core library for the kyanite project

Cross-platform hardware and system telemetry library,<br>
exposing a unified interface for CPU, GPU, Memory, Drive, Network, Process, and System metrics.

> [!WARNING]
> This library is in active early development (`>= 1.0.0-alpha`).
> APIs will change, features are incomplete, and it is **not** recommended for production use yet.

## Overview

`kyanite-core` is a systems-level telemetry library written in Rust.
It exposes a single `Telemetry` aggregate that collects data from all subsystems in parallel and caches the results in immutable snapshots,
so consumers can read without triggering any I/O.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status           |
|----------|------------------|
| Linux    | Work in progress |
| Windows  | Work in progress |
| macOS    | Not planned      |

### Features

- **Cross-platform** – Linux and Windows implementations behind a single interface
- **Snapshot-based** – each service caches its state, consumers read without I/O
- **Concurrent updates** – `Telemetry::update_all()` uses `rayon` to update every service in parallel
- **Serde-ready** – all snapshot models serialize/deserialize out of the box
- **Feature-gated** – enable only what you need via Cargo features

---

## Usage

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
kyanite-core = { version = "1.0.0-alpha.1", features = ["telemetry"] }
```

Basic example:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

use kyanite_core::Telemetry;

fn main() {
    let mut telemetry = Telemetry::new();

    telemetry.update_all();
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    telemetry.update_all();

    println!("{:?}", telemetry.cpu.snapshot());
}
```

For a full example covering all subsystems, see [`examples/dump.rs`](examples/dump.rs):

```sh
cargo run --example dump --features telemetry
```
